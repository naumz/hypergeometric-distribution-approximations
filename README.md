# hypergeometric-distribution-approximations
Contains various codes to approximate hypergeometric distributions, with emphasis on confidence interval estimation

The code is written in MATLAB and consists of:
1. approx_comparison.m - To determine probability distributions of various approximations to hypergeometric distribution.

2. bino_p.m - To determine confidence interval widths and coverage probabilities of sampling from population with replacement - binomial distribution

3. hypgeo_D.m - To determine confidence interval widths and coverage probabilities of sampling from population without replacement - hypergeometric distribution

4. norm2_comparison.m - To determine errors in approximation of hypergeometric distribution

Each script is self-contained.
